Sure! Here are the detailed steps to interrupt the boot process and reset the root password on a Red Hat-based system:

### Interrupting the Boot Process to Reset the Root Password

1. **Reboot the System**:
   - If the system is running, reboot it. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+Del` or using the command:
     ```bash
     reboot
     ```

2. **Access the GRUB Menu**:
   - During the boot process, you will see the GRUB menu. If the GRUB menu is hidden, press `Esc` to bring it up.

3. **Edit the GRUB Menu Entry**:
   - Use the arrow keys to highlight the default boot entry.
   - Press `e` to edit the selected boot entry.

4. **Modify the Kernel Parameters**:
   - Find the line that starts with `linux` or `linux16`. This line specifies the kernel and its parameters.
   - At the end of this line, add the following parameters:
     ```bash
     rd.break
     ```
   - This will break the boot process and drop you into an emergency shell.

5. **Boot into the Emergency Shell**:
   - Press `Ctrl+X` or `F10` to boot with the modified parameters. The system will boot into an emergency shell.

6. **Remount the Root Filesystem**:
   - The root filesystem is mounted in read-only mode. Remount it in read-write mode:
     ```bash
     mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
     ```

7. **Change the Root Filesystem Context**:
   - Switch to the root filesystem context:
     ```bash
     chroot /sysroot
     ```

8. **Reset the Root Password**:
   - Use the `passwd` command to reset the root password:
     ```bash
     passwd
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter and confirm the new root password.

9. **Relabel SELinux Contexts**:
   - Create an empty file to ensure SELinux contexts are relabeled on the next boot:
     ```bash
     touch /.autorelabel
     ```

10. **Exit and Reboot**:
    - Exit the chroot environment:
      ```bash
      exit
      ```
    - Remount the root filesystem as read-only:
      ```bash
      mount -o remount,ro /
      ```
    - Reboot the system:
      ```bash
      reboot
      ```

The system will reboot, and SELinux will relabel the filesystem. After the reboot, you should be able to log in with the new root password.
